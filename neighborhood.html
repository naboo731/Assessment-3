            Middletown, DE is in the county of New Castle in the second smallest state in the U.S.A. Middletown is a booming town above the state capital. It is 1 hour away from Philadelphia, 1.5 hours from Balitmore, and 3 hours away from New York City. <br>
            <br>
            Middletown is home to the Olde Tyme Peach Festival, an annual tradition that attracts tens of thousands of visitors each August. Main Street in the center of town is closed to traffic and activities begin with a parade down the street. Other entertainment includes local art and historical exhibits, live music, crafts, games, and a variety of food including limited time peach flavored treats. There is also a 5k run/walk on the same day of the festival, where all proceeds are donated to benefit the local sports boosters.
            <br>
            <br>
            Middletown also hosts an annual Hummers parade. The parade's name is a spoof of the nearby Philadelphia Mummers parade. As opposed to the Mummers, which is judged seriously, the Hummers dress up and make fun of all the popular news headlines, political, celebrity, and local happenings of the year.
